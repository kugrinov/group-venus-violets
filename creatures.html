          <img src="images/centaur.jpeg" alt="centaur" />
        </div>
        <p>
          Centaurs are half-man, half-horse creatures that lived in the
          mountains of Thessaly. The upper part of the body is of the man and
          switches at the torso. Typical centaur nature involved wildness and
          plenty enjoyment of alcohol. Chiron is a notable expection as a
          centaur who is wise and level-headed.

          <img src="images/cereberus.jpeg" alt="cerberus" />
        </div>
        <p>
          Cerberus, also known as the Hound of Hades, is the guard dog of the
          Underworld ensuring no dead can leave. Cerberus is typically depicted
          as having three monsterous heads although some interpretations have as
          many as fifty heads.

          <img src="images/chimera.jpeg" alt="chimera" />
        </div>
        <p>
          Chimera is a sibling beast to Cerberus. The creature is a hybrid of
          lion, goat, snake, and dragon features. It could fly with their dragon
          wings and wreak havoc with its fire-breath. The original Chimera was
          slain by Bellerophon.

          <img src="images/gorgon.jpeg" alt="gorgon" />
        </div>
        <p>
          Gorgons are winged-female creatures with hair made of snakes. Looking
          a gorgon in the eye causes the viewer to abruptly turn to stone and
          die. The most notable gorgon is Medusa along with her two sisters,
          Stheno and Euryale.

        </div>
        <p>
          Another half-man, half-beast, minotaurs are represented with the head
          and tail of a bull and the body of a man. The minotaur was conceived
          through the union of wife of King Minos of Crete and the sacred bull.
          It was then confined to Daedalus's labyrinth.

          <img src="images/sirens.jpeg" alt="siren" />
        </div>
        <p>
          In Greek Mythology, Sirens are creatures with female faces and chests
          and the wings and lower body of birds. Some present-day depictions are
          closer to that of a mermaid. Their hypnotizing voices lured sailors to
          their deaths.
