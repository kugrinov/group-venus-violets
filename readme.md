### Key Takeaways

We are doing this project to get experience working in a group setting and using collaboration to work towards a common goal. We are also puting our previously learned web development skills such as:html; java; basic scripting; naviagations; to use.

### Core Webpages

Index page- pick between the following pages

Gods page- depicts gods and goddesses with basic information on their relationships and brief descriptions of who they are and what they do, clicking on individual gods or characters will bring up a page that delves deeper into that character with more information on that specific individual

Titans- similar to gods page but for titans

Mythical Creatures- similar to gods page but for creatures

Myths and Heroes- a page with a list of myths with hypertext linking to the heroes description below and potentially to other pages if a god or creature is mentioned

Worship page- specific examples and explanation of the worship of these gods



Basically a wikepedia-like website with myths linking to information pages on the various characters
