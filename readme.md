### Core Webpages

Index page- pick between the following pages

"family tree" page- depicts gods and goddesses with rudementary visual information on thier relationships, clicking on individual gods or characters will bring up a page that delves deeper into that character with more information on that specific individual

Gods and deities- the page that shows up following selection of a god from the "family tree" page Includes itemized list of all gods and characters freatures around the site, separated into catagories based on nature distinguishing the different kinds of gods olympians, titans, cthonic etc

Mythical Creatures- itemized list of featured creatures throughout the myths and family tree pages catagorized by humanoid, "frankenstein esque", elemental etc.
