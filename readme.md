## Venus Violets Final Project

### Project Summary

Our topic is Greek Mythology and our website will provide an overview of some of the major elements to users. This includes the major gods, titans myths, creatures, and ways of worship. For interactivity, users will have the opportunity to like their favorite titans. They will also be able to upload there own ideas for new creatures and titans through a form on the webpage.

### Key Takeaways

We are doing this project to get experience working in a group setting and using collaboration to work towards a common goal. We are also puting our previously learned web development skills such as:html; java; basic scripting; naviagations; to use.

### Core Webpages

Index page- pick between the following pages

Gods page- depicts gods and goddesses with basic information on their relationships and brief descriptions of who they are and what they do, clicking on individual gods or characters will bring up a page that delves deeper into that character with more information on that specific individual

Titans- similar to gods page but for titans

Mythical Creatures- similar to gods page but for creatures

Myths and Heroes- a page with a list of myths with hypertext linking to the heroes description below and potentially to other pages if a god or creature is mentioned

Worship page- specific examples and explanation of the worship of these gods

Basically a wikepedia-like website with myths linking to information pages on the various characters

### Design Choices

[Mythopedia](https://mythopedia.com/)
[GodChecker](https://www.godchecker.com/)
[American Folklore Society](https://americanfolkloresociety.org/)

Throughout the website there will be patterns and colors often used in ancient greek art. These colors include olive greens, browns, and pale parchment. The website uses a serif font since it is more traditional than sans-serif fonts to match the long history of Greek Mythology. Each page's layout will group similar content together in boxes to make the information clear to the user.

Data Collections:
Custom Creature Collection, properties: name, heads, colors, and ability
Titan Collection, properties: name, domain, description; alo tracks likes and a delete option
