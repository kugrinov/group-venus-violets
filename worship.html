            Altars are a very common way to worship many deities, especially the
            Greek gods, goddesses, and even heroes. There are many types of
            altars that can be crafted including temporary and travel altars for
            people who may not be able to worship their gods openly. Most altars
            start with the incense cleansing of a space, candles, statues, and
            items that remind the worshipper of the god such as flowers,
            crystals, trinkets, or any personal touches. There are many
            different types of altars, but the main thing to be aware of is that
            the space needs to be designated to that deity because anything that
            is set on the altar, even by accident, will be seen as an offering,
            and is difficult to get back (especially if the god you worship is
            stubborn or extremely playful).

            Prayer is a common way that many people worship gods or goddesses.
            It is a way to communicate with the god or goddess you are trying to
            worship directly. Many people use prayer beads as a way to help them
            feel more connected, and those usually consist of chains and beads
            along with charms that the user feels represents their god or
            goddess. Prayers are very personal and can be very simple or vy
            complex depending on what the devotee feels is right. There is no
            real wrong way to pray, just remember to be respectful and
            considerate when praying. You can also use this to ask for signs or
            symbols that can help let you know your god or goddess is listening.

            Offerings go hand in hand with altars for the gods and goddesses.
            Many people will leave a designated spot like a platform or bowl on
            top of their altars as an offering area. These offerings can include
            food, drinks, gems, handmade crafts, flowers, and much more. It is
            also a good idea to light the candle you have on your designated
            altar and look into flame communication to try and see if your god
            or goddess is accepting of the offer or would prefer that you remove
            it. There is no rhyme or reason to offerings, it can be scheduled or
            at random. But it can be especially helpful when asking for guidance
            from a specific god because it shows a sort of devotion besides just
            expecting a reward.
